# Compress INO TIFF Files
TiffLib is used to compress multipage FLIM Hyperspectral TIFFs Generated by the INO FHS Software
<br><br>
Here we provide a MatLab script with a GUI to compress the INO TIFFs.
The user will select the source folder and the destination folder.<br>
The script will first create a list of all the files in the folder then loop through them. <br>
The FLIM and Hyperspectral cubes are compressed using the "LZW" lossless algorithm.<br>
The acquisition and the microscope metadata are saved in the XML tiff tag.<br>
The xml2struct.m script is used to parse the XML data.<br>
Non-TIFF data is directly copied to the new file.<br>
If the script fails to copy/compress a file due to corruption, a log file is generated with a list of failed files.
