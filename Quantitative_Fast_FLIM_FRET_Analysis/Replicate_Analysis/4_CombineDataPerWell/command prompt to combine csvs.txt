Next we need to combine the .CSV files for each well.  Use command prompt to do this.  Note, cmd will not work to access the Network * so just make a copy of the “Result csv” folder on the desktop.     
In command prompt 
 Type directory location. for example if my data is in the G drive type "G:" to change to the G directory
 Type: ‘cd’ (space) then paste the location of your Result csv folder on the desktop. This will change the directory to the location of your folder on the desktop.  
 Check that you are in the correct location by typing ‘dir’ and press enter. This will show you all the names of the files in that location.
 Copy and paste this line:  

For %i in (A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P) DO For /L %j in (1,1,24) Do copy /b WellID_%i%j-* combined_%i%j.csv

Now a “combined_csv” file will be made for each well.  Cut only these combined files to a folder in your results folder on the Network. We will call this folder “combined csvs”.  Delete the remaining copy of the csvs on the desktop.
